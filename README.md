<h3>What will you find in this repository</h3>

<p>This repository was created to showcase some exercises and codes that were done in class during my second semester coursing Computer Science at Anhembi Morumbi University.
The semester will end on the 08/12, and that is when you can expect to see a small update in this file with a better presentation of what I've done throughout the semester.</p>

<h3>About my University</h3>

<p>Universidade Anhembi Morumbi is a Brazilian private university located in São Paulo and member of the Laureate International Universities group.
Ranked one of the top three private universities in the state of São Paulo, the university is one of the most prestigious in various areas of knowledge such as medicine,
engineering, business, communication, gastronomy and fashion design. UAM is also known as the first international university of Brazil.</p>

<h3>The Computer Science course at Anhembi Morumbi</h3>

<p>The Computer Science course at Anhembi Morumbi, from the very first semester, aims to stimulate the development of specialized workforce,
working towards the teaching of the most modern and innovative technologies and methods available on the market, like programing using Java,
mobile and web development languages,which provides the student with many of the expected skills for the I.T. area. The University has been chosen by
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), one of the biggest software developer companies in the world, for a partnership that offers specialized trainings for the students,
besides other kinds of strategic partnerships with well known I.T.companies like NVIDIA, IBM, Oracle, Cisco, RIM, EMC, Microsoft and others.</p>

<h3>Why have I chosen to study a I.T. course</h3>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I was always the "Techie Guy'' or the "Geek Friend" in every social group I'm in, but when i was younger,
I've never had the thought of actually doing any kind of I.T. work for a living. After I graduated from High School,
I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do as a career, so I took some time to invest in my development as a person,
and moved to the U.K at the age of 19 years old. To be a foreigner in a country you don't really speak the language and don't know anyone,
away from your family and everyone you've ever known at the age of 19 was a very tough and scary scenario. I've lived in the city of Oxford,
in the heart of England for around about 3 years, where I've worked in a few different places, made friends from all over the world, had good times,
bad times, but in every job I had, one thing was in common, once again, I was always the guy they would call to solve a problem,
sometimes with an electronic like a computer, tablet or with the internet,
and that was when I felt that I very was appreciated for being good doing something that was fun and easy for me, and most importantly,
something that I started love doing. In that moment I've found what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Now, after my first six months studying really hard programming,
I can say that I couldn't be happier.</p>
